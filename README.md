Why to learn Sanskrit?

Sanskrit is India’s gift to the world that is unparallel in its perfection and preciseness. It isregarded as the mother of all modern languages and historians often call it the “perfect language”. This is not without reason as Sanskrit is a language that has the most number of letters and aksharas compared to any other language.
Reasons why Sanskrit is crucial for today’s world
1. Computers require algorithmic programming and scientific research has found Sanskrit to be the perfect language for this purpose. Its preciseness and variety owe to this research.
2. Sanskrit is one language that can convey the biggest word meanings, quantitatively and qualitatively in the least amount of words. Owing to the abundance of words and preciseness of letters, it is most expressive. It is sometimes called the “poems of everyday life”.

3. Sanskrit has the largest library of words in comparison to any language. It is said to have 102 Arab, 87 Crore and 50 Lakh words (Hindi units have been used) that have been used via scriptures, books, speaking etc. In fac, professors say that a similar amount of words can be generated from these words within the next 100-150 years.

4. In the modern world, we want everything fast and we want it now. To study a language like Sanskrit, one requires calmness of mind, patience and reverence for the language. This ancient science has been ruthlessly plundered, looted and misinterpreted by foreign plunderers who were unable to fathom the greatness of its existence.
